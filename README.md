# Zomato Restaurant Expansion Analysis in Excel

## Overview
This project analyzes Zomato’s restaurant data using *Microsoft Excel* to uncover patterns, opportunities, and recommendations for expansion. The aim is to identify cities, cuisines, and service types with the greatest potential for new restaurants based on historical data, ratings, delivery trends, and locality-level insights.

## Problem Statement
Zomato operates in a highly competitive market. To expand efficiently, it’s crucial to analyze which cities, cuisines, and localities provide the best prospects. Questions addressed include: *Which cities are under-served? What cuisines are in demand? Where is customer engagement highest?*

## Dataset
- **Source:** Zomato restaurant datasets covering multiple countries and key Indian cities.
- **Tables/Sheets:** Country, City, Restaurant Details, Ratings, Cuisines, Delivery & Table Booking Services.
- **Key Fields:** Restaurant Name, City, Country, Locality, Cuisines, Ratings, Cost, Has Delivery, Has Table Booking, Customer Votes.

## Approach

- **Data Cleaning & Processing:**
  - Removed duplicates and standardized city/locality names.
  - Used Excel functions (Text-to-Columns, VLOOKUP, Data Filters) to organize data[1][2].

- **Descriptive Analysis:**
  - Created PivotTables to summarize number of restaurants by city, cuisine, service type, and ratings.
  - Calculated growth opportunities in cities/localities with high demand but fewer restaurants[1][2].

- **Visualization:**
  - Developed dashboards with Pivot Charts, Slicers, and interactive visual elements.
  - Key insights highlighted with maps, bar/column charts, and KPI cards (e.g., Top growth cities, Trending cuisines)[1][2].

- **Expansion Recommendations:**
  - Identified high-potential cities/localities (based on gaps in supply vs demand).
  - Highlighted popular and under-served cuisines for each region.
  - Suggested tables for cities where online delivery/table booking is in demand but not widely available[3].

## Key Findings

- Certain cities (e.g., Bangalore Electronic City, select NCR localities) show underserved demand for new restaurants—especially for trending cuisines like South Indian and fusion foods[3].
- Customer preference analytics: Cuisines with high reviews and ratings but limited presence suggest expansion opportunities.
- Delivery and table booking features are critical market differentiators in urban centers.
- Pricing and ratings: Restaurants with medium price points and high ratings fare best for expansion strategy.

## Project Dashboard
- Comprehensive dashboards and visualizations are available in the `/dashboards` folder (with slicers for interactive exploration).
